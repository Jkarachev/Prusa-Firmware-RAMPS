# Unoriginal Prusa i3 MK2 Firmware

This is the Prusa i3 MK2 Firmware v3.1.0 modified to run on RAMPS. Everything works as you'd expect, except for automatic bed current setting; you'll have to keep fiddling with those potentiometers for now.

The config file has also been modified for my printer, so before running please set the steps/mm and motor/endstop inverting as necessary.
