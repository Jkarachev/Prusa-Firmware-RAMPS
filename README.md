# Unoriginal Prusa i3 MK2 Firmware for RAMPS

I've got my hands on a MK42 heatbed clone, so now all I need is the software to get that sweet, sweet, autocalibration. But wait, it only runs on RAMBO boards, and you cheaped out and bought a RAMPS! Never fear, dear reader, for I know how to edit config files and copy-paste removed pinouts from the equivalent version of Marlin. I can fix this!

I'm porting the most recent version of the Prusa firmware to RAMPS 1.4 so that I can use it on my self-sourced i3 MK2 clone. How hard can it be?
