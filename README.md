# Unoriginal Prusa i3 MK3 Firmware

Now that the MK3 is out and the firmware is fresh, I have to modify it to run on RAMPS again. Last time I didn't really plan for the future, but this time, I'm hoping whatever modifications I make can be easily ported forward as Prusa releases newer versions. I also managed to get my hands on some TMC2130 drivers, so I'll be trying to get those working too, on my mutant Prusa i3 MK2.3 or whatever. If only Marlin supported XYZ calibration like Prusa does, then I wouldn't have to do any of this...
